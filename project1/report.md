# Singapore Jobs Explorer — Project Report

## 1. Business case

- **Scenario:** Career coaches and job seekers in Singapore want a quick, trustworthy view of which roles are being advertised and what pay the adverts list.
- **Objective:** Help a coach or job seeker compare advertised role volume, listed pay, and competition across industries, career levels, and time, so that a first career conversation starts from evidence.
- **Value:** A filterable dashboard that answers "where are the jobs, what do they pay, and how competitive are they?" without reading a million adverts. It is an exploration tool. It does not predict hiring and does not show who was hired.

## 2. Data handling and process

- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, and Streamlit.
- **Data:** `data/SGJobData.csv` contains 1,048,585 rows and 22 columns, one row per job advert. The dashboard opens on the first 50,000 rows by default and offers the full file.
- **Sampling first:** We checked shape, column types, and the range of each numeric column on a 50,000-row sample before running the full file.
- **Quality checks:** Missing values, repeated job IDs, impossible salaries, and date parsing. 3,988 rows (0.38%) are entirely empty apart from a zero salary; they are dropped. The remaining 1,044,597 job IDs are all unique, so no duplicate removal was needed. We keep the de-duplication step as a safeguard.
- **Cleaning:**
  - Zero salaries are treated as "not disclosed", not as pay of zero, so they are set to missing.
  - Where the minimum exceeds the maximum, the two values are swapped.
  - Salaries that are impossible for a monthly figure are set to missing rather than corrected.
  - Job titles are normalised (marketing prefixes such as "Urgent hiring!!!" and trailing pay phrases are removed) so that one role is counted once.
  - The `categories` field is a JSON array. A job can sit in several categories, so it is expanded: one row per posting per category.
- **Feature engineering:** Nine official position levels are collapsed into five seniority bands (Entry, Junior, Mid, Senior, Management). Salary is the provided average where present, otherwise the midpoint of the minimum and maximum. Posting trends use the original posting date, and only from May 2023 onward (see Limitations).
- **Result:** 1,044,597 cleaned postings from 53,150 organisations, offering 2,725,717 vacancies across 43 categories.

## 3. Key findings (full cleaned file)

- **Pay:** The median advertised monthly salary is **S$3,850**; the middle 50% of postings span **S$2,950–S$5,500**. The mean is about S$824 higher than the median, because a small number of very high adverts raise it. The median is therefore the headline figure.
- **Pay rises with seniority (median monthly):** Entry S$2,675 (250,269 postings); Junior S$3,150 (167,656); Mid S$4,000 (365,909); Senior S$5,000 (100,459); Management S$6,500 (160,304).
- **Size and pay differ:** Information Technology has the most postings in the cleaned data (140,866; median S$6,500). Admin / Secretarial is large (117,854) but has one of the lowest medians (S$2,900).
- **Competition varies widely:** Applications per vacancy (total applications ÷ total vacancies) range from about 0.15 in Personal Care / Beauty and 0.21 in F&B to about 1.5 in Marketing / Public Relations and 2.2 in Risk Management.
- **Entry-friendly roles:** About 36% of postings ask for one year or less of experience. Customer Service and Admin / Secretarial are above 50%.

## 4. Dashboard / app

- **Solution:** Streamlit web app with filters for industry / category, career level, and employment type. All charts and cards use the same filtered rows.
- **Summary cards:** Job postings, number of categories, median listed salary, and salary coverage (the share of postings that list a salary).
- **Overview tab:** Most-posted job titles (cleaned names) and posting volume by category.
- **Salary tab:** Median listed salary for the top categories. Postings without a valid salary are excluded.
- **Posting trends tab:** Postings by month, from the original posting date. Read with the May 2023 limitation in mind.
- **Data quality tab:** Missing salaries, dates that could not be read, duplicate rows, and a table preview. It lets a user check whether a chart is reliable before relying on it.
- **Screenshots:** Overview and Salary tab, taken from the live app (first 50,000 rows and full file as noted).

## 5. Challenges, learnings, and next steps

- **Challenge — zero-coded salaries:** 3,988 rows were blank apart from a zero salary. Treating zero as pay would have dragged every pay summary down, so zero is treated as missing and the empty rows are removed.
- **Challenge — overlapping categories:** A job can belong to up to five categories. The notebook counts each posting once per category it belongs to, so IT shows 140,866. The dashboard uses only the first category listed, so its category counts are lower and differ from the notebook's.
- **Challenge — data-collection change:** View and application counts before about May 2023 are not comparable with later months, so trend charts and growth figures start from May 2023.
- **Learning:** A numeric zero can be a missing-data code. Salary, title, and date completeness must be checked together. A trend can reflect how data was collected rather than what happened in the market.
- **Limitation — outliers:** Some salaries are far outside the normal range (a raw maximum of S$25,330,000, and 279 raw postings with a maximum above S$100,000). These were not used for the pay medians, but the upper tail should be reviewed before anyone draws conclusions from it.
- **Limitation — adverts, not hires:** Posting counts and listed pay describe what employers advertised. They do not show hiring outcomes, applicant quality, or how many people are looking for work.
- **Next steps:** Review the extreme salaries one by one; add a clearer view of overlapping categories; test the app on the full file; and ask career coaches and job seekers to try the dashboard and report what is confusing.

## How to run

Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then run `streamlit run app.py`. The app defaults to the first 50,000 rows of the supplied CSV; choose "All rows" in the sidebar for the full dataset.
